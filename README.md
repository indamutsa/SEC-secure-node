In this last module, we will cover how to use Single Sign-On (SSO) with Github OAuth2.0.
We will use passport and passport-github2 to authenticate users with Github.
We can also use any other OAuth2.0 provider like Google, Facebook, or Twitter.
Okta is another popular OAuth2.0 provider.

For more informaton, please refer to the readme inside the [playground](./playground/README.md) folder.
